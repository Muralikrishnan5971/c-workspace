Algorithm Techniques

1. TWO POINTER TECHNIQUE
------------------------
-> two pointer technique is used to solving problems that involves
searching for a value or a range of values in a array or string.

-> to use this technique most of the time the input must be sorted
in some order, which helps to reduce the time complexity to
O(n2) or O(n3) to O(n) of just one loop with two pointers and
search each item once.

-> so depending on the input array/string is sorted or not, the two
pointer method can take O(n logn) time complexity or even better O(n)

-> this technique also saves space by only using two pointers instead
of creating an additional array or any other data structure.

-> usage:
* finding a pair of numbers in a sorted array that add up to
a target value.
* finding a subarray in a array that has a given sum.
* finding a subarray in a array that has a given product.
* checking if a string is a palindrome.
* finding the longest substring in a stiring that is a palindrome
* finding the intersection of two sorted arrays.
