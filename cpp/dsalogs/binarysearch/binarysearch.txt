BINARY SEARCH
-------------

its a searching algoritm in a limiting searching space.
binary search is applicable only for a sorted search space.

arr[] = {1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 21}

1. the search space must be sorted.
2. take two pointers low and high, such that low is the first index
 and high is the last index.

 low = 0
 high = n - 1, where n is the size of the array, 6 - 1 = 5

3. lets take 7 is the target
4. find mid index as m = (low + high)/2 ie (0 + 5)/2 = 2

5. if target value is less than mid value, change high pointer to
before the mid point

if t < m,
h = m - 1

6. if target value is greater than mid value, change low pointer to
after the mid point

if t > m,
l = m + 1;

7. continue this process untill there is no search space
ie., low in greater than or equal to hight

while(l <= h) condition fails
