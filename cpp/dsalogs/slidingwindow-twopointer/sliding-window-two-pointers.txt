SLIDING WINDOW & TWO POINTERS
-----------------------------

Framework of thought for sliding window or two pointer

1. there should be a Order of input (ascending or descending)
2. construct machine
    * set left and right pointer
    * get value of the machine (based on the problem)
3. observe the values of the left and the right pointer
4. try and move the pointers based on the required value

Example:

1. TwoSum Problem

arr = { 1, 3, 4, 2, 7}

value = 9

Left pointer = 1
Right pointer = 4

4 + 1 = 5
5 < 9

Hence move left pointer i.e., l++
